### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### About Me

I have over 5 years of experience interpreting business ideas and building turn-key feature-rich elegantly-interfaced applications. I am experienced in front-end, back-end and cloud pipelines. I have competencies in leading, taking initiative, prioritizing and delegating tasks among team members.  

My Portfolio website: https://chizaram-igolo.github.io/ (It will be getting a major redesign soon!)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a language learning platform - something similar to Duolingo, but focusing on lesser known languages. I'm also in the process of building my own UI Libraries for Front-End Web Development to help bootstrap applications faster.
